# DATA-STRUCT-ALGO_UESTC_C
Hi, here are some codes which I implemented with C, during my time studying Data Structure Algorithm in China.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips:
The comments I wrote at that time were all written in Chinese, but you can specify the functions by each file's name,
and also in the information below:

1. linked.list.c 

This program intends to implement:

  (1) Create Single linked list with the header.
  
  (2) Delete, insert nodes.
  
  (3) Emerge 2 lists, and use bubble-sort to keep the emerged list descendingÂ accoring to each students' ages.

2. huffman.c

This program intends to implement:

  (1) Create huffman tree for input characters.
  
  (2) Build huffman codes table
  
  (3) Show frequency and huffman code for each input info

3. Kruskal.c

This program intends to implement:

  (1) Create Graphs
  
  (2) Kruskal ALGO

4. sort.c

This program intends to implement:

  (1) Quick Sort, recursion
  
  (2) Binary Search
